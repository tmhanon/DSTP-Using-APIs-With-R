This repository hosts the slides and source code from my Enhanced Learning Session for the USDA Data Science Training Program titled "Working with APIs in R". 

The presentation mostly focuses on using the [`httr2`](https://httr2.r-lib.org/index.html) package to build and execute HTTP requests. I demonstrated accessing data from two USDA API services: [Datamart](https://mpr.datamart.ams.usda.gov/), a source for mandatory reporting data, and [My Market News](https://mymarketnews.ams.usda.gov/), a source for Market News data across USDA. 

I also discuss some basic API definitions, including demonstrating how authentication using an API key works, but I am by no means an expert on API architecture. 

The [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) source code that renders the slides is in the `index.qmd` file. The slides and associated files are located in the `docs` folder, with `index.html` being the slides themselves.
